# Calculator

This is a calculator project built from [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

The goal of this project is to: 
1. practice utilizing the javascript (DOM manipulation/events) taught in the course
2. practice and continue learning additional javascript and css (animations)
3. challenge myself to replicate Apple iPhone's calculator design.
